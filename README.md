# Third-Party-Api-Calendar
This is a workday scheduling application that allows you to store data in local storage. As time proceeds throughout the day, the coloration of the textboxes will change to reflect whether the time blocks are in the past present or future relative to the day. 

**TO USE**
The application functions very simply.  Type what you would like into the text box, and press the button to the right of the textbox to save the data in local storage.  There are two options for clearing data.  One can either delete the text from the box and save individually, or you can press the clear scheduler button at the top of the page.  Data will persist for as long as it remains in local storage.
